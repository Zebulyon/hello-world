The party finds themselves inside a tavern. They have recently hit on hard times, having spent their last rewrads on fancy booze, meal, gambling and partners of the night. 

On your travels looking for a job you find yourself in a village on the outer permimeters of of the country of Z-onia. 
The town is quite small mostly living off the trades it makes with the traders on their journey to capital. But the cost of 
living is cheap and many traders like to employ guards that are familiar with the lay of land to the capitals and the dangers that lie along it. 


You have posted an advert on the town bullitin board and are currently sitting at a table in the town midclass tavern, drinking cheap mead and stomaching the watered down slopp they serve. 
The town is populated by day drinkers and some of the commonfolk looking for a lunch. 
The tavern possess a distinct smell old basement tough the owners have tried to mask the stench using some fern sticks hanging around in somewhat orderly and well thought manner to cover most of the tavern. 
A small but comfy fire is a lit in the fireplace, and one of the two serving maids is currently in the process of cleaning of some slopp that had fallen on the floor. 
So far not even a nibble of someone willing to hire you and it has been couple of days since you posted it, and your are starting to get worried for what to do in 3 days when you will officially be broke.

- 
Give the scene for the player. 
Allow them to describe how each one of them envision their characthers and how they are handeling the bad times. 
Give them at most 5 min for the scene after which inteject with
-
Your attention is suddenly directed towards the front door as voice's are raised in supprise and irritation, as a Goat rams through the door causing some recently arrived bar patrons to splat down on their ass and knocking over a table. 
The goat seems to be in a state of panic gliding and running around almost looking for something. It makes a muffled baah sound as it seems to carefully carry a scroll of some kind in its mouth. 
It quickly seems to hone in on your table and runs up to it, nudging [MAGE] with its head trying and dropping the scroll on your table. 
The scroll seems to be a couple of years old, having been sun bleached and its edges have begun to tear apart from being dried out, it carries a wax seal portraying a shinning star.  
The goats seems to have done its best to not damage the scroll only leaving a small blotch of spittle and teeth marks. 

- 
The scene is given back to the Players asking them how to respond to the current situation, they have 5-10 min on giving their response and learning the secrets of the scroll before the sound of howling can be heards and loud footsteps approaching. 

A ARCANA (15) or HISTORY (20) check revealse that the insignia is the mark of a Master Transmuter by the name of Shinebright that lives somewhere in the surrounding area. 
Any proficient in ARCANA will imidietly recognise the Scroll as a Scroll of Speak with Animals. Using the scroll simply requires them to read the enchantation on it no roll required. 
Upon being used all people present will be able to speak with animals for 12h. 

The party might be called to explain the situation regarding the goat to the other patrons as the goats seems to have caused the ruckous running towards them. 
A simple Persusaion check (10) or a INTIMDATION (15) should cause the onlookers to calm down and give them some breathing room. 

If any of their passive perception is 15 or greater allow them to roll the next iniative with advantage.

You suddenly hear ruckous from outside the tavern as some people shout for others to hide. Followed by howling from a multiple large dogs. 
After which through the front door three large wolfs burst through the door growling towards the closest bar patron signaling them to back off. 
This is imidietly followd by a large of brute of a half-orc burst through the door causing it snap of its hinges, he is in turn followed by a large individual in a cloak covering their head. 

The half-orc looks over the room and his attention seems to be focus in on your table. 
As he points towards you and say, that Goat belongs to master Nook return it now or else there will be problem. 
- 
The Scene is then giving back to the player as Guz waits for their response. 

The players have 5 min to give a response that Guz would care to listen too before he sickes the wolfs on them. 

The wolfs a 3 Dire wolfs    
CR (1)*3
The hulking figure in cloak is a Polar Bear. 
CR (2)
With Guz being an Half-orc berserker with a Whirling Greatsword, a large Greatsword with a reach of 5ft that allows its user to attack two seperate targets within range with each attack. 
CR (2)
- Guz and Co. will act with human level intelligence, and as entities under the employ of a powerful wizard they know the power of a spellcaster represents and will do what they can to distrupt concentration and not allow them to gain significant distance. 
- I'm thinking that the wolfs and bear is somewhat capabel to use tools and if the PC begin to steamroll they might go about to start using tools and their environment to their advantage. 



The player can either fight head-on attempt to sway some of the other patrons for assistance or hold out for 5 rounds after which city guards will begin appear assisting the player characthers. 
Or possibly flee the scene. 

Tough fleeing the scene will mean that Guz will be present for the final battle.
