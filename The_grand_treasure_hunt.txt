	The Grand Treasure Hunt
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Overview Description : 
You will be adventurers with a captial "A", likely globtrotting around the world on a grand treasure hunt. 
This "hunt" can lead the PC's to have to clear a dungeon, climb a mountain peak, travers the sea's, or obtain 
some item that could be a clue for the hunt which already is in the possesion of some noble man be it peaceful or violent. 
Meaning a wide range of skills can be useful. Tough skills with a focus on travelling will be repeatedly used . . . 

In this campaign you are going to be adventurers with a capital "A", partaking in a globetrotting adventure to the far 
reaches of the world. 
This journey is going to lead you to have to face different enviromental hazards and challanges, examples being ancient 
sprawling catacombs, mountain peaks, the open sea's, scorching desert suns and freezing thundra. 
Specifically at different points in the journey I will ask you if there is a specific type of environment that you would like 
to explore, and if you fail to come up I will provide som examples and let you choose. 
There will be opperntunities to establish a base of operations but your are going to be traveling a lot so deep long lasting 
social and political intregue and slow cooking plot twist is likely to be in the reserve. 

I recommend that your character is able to bring something to the table when it comes to making the traveling sections of 
journey easiers, there will alsways be hierlings and NPC available to help, but they will ask for payment and will not be as
good as you yourself would be. 
So access to skills such as multiple languages, traveling skills such as boating, riding etc. 
Knowledge skills, Botany, History, Lore, Survival. 
All area's does not need to be covered there will be skill tutors available to allow grant you passing knowledge in 
exchange for coins. 
Also with long travling time to some desitinations could mean access to a lot of down time, so might be good to put some 
idea into what you will do during your downtime, gambling, crafting, training, socialicing, etc. 
Now this is still Hackmaster so combat will of course be a big focus as well. 

We are also going to start in Medias Res, where you guys already are a team, where you have accepted a mission to aid a 
poor village chief with saving his daugther as she needs medicine or else she will die. 
You will all be paid, with enough cash to be able to live comfortably in a inn for 2 months. 
So with that please create PC's that would be willing to take on such a mission, in regards to player alignment etc. 
I'm not saying that all of you need to be boyscouts on the level of superman, just that your are not raving assholes. 

-----

I want the characters to be made collevtivly during a session 0, This will likely take a session. 
The goal will be to have the general information regarding your PC proerly established, where upon you will then on your 
owntime expand on more specific details. 

Goal. 

Roll for Stats
Decide Race 
Decide Class 
Quirks and Flaws
And roll for life events. 
Come up with idea's for your core personality traits, 
Make sure that all these characthers are willing to travel with one-another. 

New Rules

I will expand a bit on the basic charachter generation rules, for a bit. 

First we will use the Central Casting Heros of Legends. 
Specifically the life event section, the players will be able to use the other section if they so choose, but will not be demanded of them. 

2 events youth/adolecense 
2 events adulthood 

Will first roll for all 4 events first then rerolls can be applied. 
with 2 rerolls. 


Secondly tough this is not something you must decide on during session 0. 

1. You will roll a 1d6 on a 1-5 you have a +1 item of your choosing on a 6 you have a +2. 
2. You will all be able to choose a category from which you will get a random magic item. OFFENSIVE, SUPPORT, MISC. 
3. You will be able during the first story arc to say that your charachter is in possesion of any 1 item of their choosing from the PHB, but they can not sell it. 
ex. You reach a ledge you have to climb down, and no one in the party has a rope, you can then use this free item and say you have a rope. 
4. Extra skills, each one of you has the ability to until the first story arc, for each other PC come up with a scenario in which you worked toghter 
previously and during which you learnt the basics of a skille of your choosing. 
ex. John and Steve are in the same playgroup, John gets put in a situation in which he realise he could use  climbing skill, 
he then quickly talks it over with Steve and tell the tale of the time that they were fleeing a boar and John hade climb over a wall to escape. 
He then can set his skill mastery of the Climbing skill to 30.

Story Outline 

The PC's will start by having accepted a mission to aid a small village, starting the adventure in medias res. 
Where they are on their way and setting up for camp.

During the night a night-time ambush will occur, Introducing the twig-blight enemy. 

During the journey evry day will offer a 75% chance of a random encounter

***

Examples being

Obstruction of their way forward, I'm thinking a rope bridge over water has collapdse. How do they want to cross, there might be a easier pass at another point along the stream, maybe they want to repair it or they might have another idea. 

Some enemy encounters, a wild boar that is serving as a host for a twig blight, which has driven it to a breaking point. it might be attacking a farmer that lives near by. 

A wounded traveler sits by the road, having ended up in a sitation where their legs i greatly injured and they are unable to continue on on their own. Maybe is an avatar of the traveler and if they care for him and take him to a safe place he will reward them with a blessing. 
On their journey with the peddler they will be attacked by some bandits, if they properly deal with the threat and make sure that their addon is safe they will be given a reward. 
Under the guidance of their companion they will be led to a safe have. 
A safe haven, a small hut large enough for up to 5-6 people stand by the road, it seems to have been sturdily made. 
The hut bears the markings of the Traveler, Dreamer and Home foundations. Having made this conjoined temple in their names to offer a  safe have and good resting place for passerby. 
These huts have recieved a blessing that only those deemed worthy are able to find them. And those unworthy will be unable to even relise that it is there. 
By having been led here they will have recieved the blessign of being able to enter these houses as long as they do not commit an act of transgression. 


A prank by some fairies, I think that one of the PC's the one in the back will spot something glimmering in silver by the side of the road, when picked up however it willl become a  skunk in their hand and some snickering will be heard from the surrounding tree tops. 

One of the PC's will spot something a long the road that will be of value, likely a jewlry that a traveler dropped. 

The resting peddler, it will be a foggy day and during the journey they will spot an individual that is resting on a stone by the side of the road, when approached they off the PC's the ability to trade, procur some rare items. Some more rare potions, and other weird consumables. 


***

At Oakhurst they will be able to garner rumors and information regarding what might lie ahead of them. 

The existance of the two different fruits. 
The goblins that come by and sell them each year. 

The story of the Great Thieves that will play a big role in the story in the future.

The odd behaviours that has been spotted in the village when they try to plant the trees and the remains of the persumed goblin attack. 
The existance of the druid that came by
Some general lore of the dungeon. 


They could also pick up the side-mission of finding the young nobles that ventured into the dungeon.
The reward will be 15 silver pieces for each ring they return with, and double that if they return the young nobles alive. 
***
I'm thinking that either the random encounter peddler could offer a cure. 
Or the midsummer fruit of the goliath tree could cure 
Or if fire is used to knock them unconcious without killing them. 
***

Oakhurst also houses a temple to a Non-evil churc. 
Dreamer, three strenghts, love, home making, peace. 
3 STR might be the remains from some human supremist from the war 100 years ago as we are close to the old dwarf mountains. 
Dreamers and Home making as a general church that could be in many places
Love and Peace having moved there to amend relations between the dwarfs and Kalaramarian people. 
I would like to avoid, churches that focus a bit more on direct actions and conflict as they would likely have dealt with the twiblight issue and goblins. 
Replanting would also likely be good to avoid as they might otherwise have relised the truth of the fruits. 

There is a general store, selling food, some misc scrolls and potions that themselves do not know what they do, but sell them at a cost of 50 SP a piece. 


***

The Sunless citadel. 

The kobolds are instead  Bav (Visitor in Klingon based on the tv Show V) or Dragonkin as they like to refere to themselves. 
They are otherwise the same as Kobolds in DnD 
---
The difference between in Bav, Kobolds and Goblin will be. 

Goblin are agent of chaos, it is belive that they are the emiserias of the gods of Torment, Fear and Vice. 
Slaves to tehir of inhibitions and derives pleasure from inflicting pain and torment to others. 
Their tactics usually involves wave rush, looking to overwhelm thei opponent, as well as underhanded tactics poison and disease.

Kobolds are more militrised, they work in strict hierchy and uses tacticts to the best of their advantage, usually quite fearfull as long unless they have a proper leader to guide them. 

Bav looks to use traps and obstacles to outsmart and place their opponent in a disadvantageous situation before they then strike. 
The Look to use evry thing and anything to their advantage, see the koblold alchemist/inventor in dnd. 
Bav are quite the scardy cats and are easily spooked, but they try to carry themselves with an air of arrogance as they belive that they are closely related to dragons and posses the ability to become one themselves if they grow old enough. 
They also strove to use and act on logic when possible seeming a bit cold hearted. 
---

If they ally themselves with the kobolds and return to them their baby Wyvern that the goblins have taken. 
Then they will be given free passage
Access to the information that they hold regarding the citadel 
The key to the locked chamber  

In the locked chamber change the troll to be an amalgamation, the remnant of a priest of tiamat that try to acend to dragonhood themselves. 
It looks like a mixture between a humanoid with the neck and tail of a snake, with two feathered wings covered in scales with a long lizard tong. 
It has a formidable resistance, DR = AVG dmg party but otherwise with onle 1 hp. 
It is capable spewing fire. 

In the coffin like pharos of old he has been buried with jewlry, balms and oils that have leaked out and dried out but also 1d3+1 scrolls of fire breath. 

The fountain that spews fire. If they take the time the can extract 1d4 flasks of alchemist fire.
