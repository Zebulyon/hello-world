    THE_PRISON_BREAK (TPB)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One-shot - Prision Break 

The PC's currently find themselves in the bottom floor of a prision, tomorrow the PC will be executed/sacrificed so that need to flee today. 
At the start of the Session, they will be asked what they have done to prepare the escape, each PC will be allowed to say what they have done to prepare. 

1. Prepared gears 
    * Made shivs
    * Potentially stolen weapons and hid them away for use
    * Might have some items hidden away in a stash that if they get to will grant them access to a variety of goddies 

2. Observered guard routines 
    * Will grant bonuses to stealth and bonus to knowledge checks 
    * Know where guards will be and when. 

3. Work on an escape route 
    * Maybe found some wall or floor tiles and worked them loose to gain shortcuts and the like 
    * Learnt the lay out allowing them to know good ways out 

4. Roused fellow inmates
    * Convince other inmates to aid them in their scheme would grant either heirling or distraction for the guards 


After deciding on what they want to have prepared a Roll will be asked for and the bonuses of their preperations will vary depending on results
and if it goes really badly might even introduce complixations. 

Potentially will have high leathality and if a PC dies they will simply be replaced by another inmate looking to flee up to certain point



I ran one a short while ago that went well (due to good dice rolling and some clever ideas)

Part one: Skill challenge to get the guards by the bars so they can be attacked. (Failure means retry later)

Part two: Combat with said guards (they should be very weak)

Part three: Skill challenge to sneak around and get some gear.(Failure means no gear)

Part four: Fighting the guards halfway out.

Part Five: Skill challenge to avoid group of guards coming in to investigate sound of fight. (Failure bing a fight)

Part six: skill challenge to get away form the possee that is pursuing them (Failure is another fight)

The party did well and got away with only three fights.

Just a quick update.

The PCs have finished making characters. All are level 4 and will start with no equipment, for the most part.

Male Human Thief. Street Urchin. Imprisoned for inciting a riot to depose the local iron-fisted tyrant.

Female Changeling Pyromancer Mage. Fluffed as a human with a knack for simple disguise spells. Imprisoned for impersonating the local iron-fisted tyrant during the riots. She managed to smuggle her implement in with her - a Hellfire Cinder Wand fluffed as a magic ring.

Male Longtooth Shifter Paladin. Worships the mysterious Death deity (similar in aspect to the Raven Queen, i.e. not evil). He is fluffed as a human with an anger management problem. Imprisoned for grotesque acts of random violence.

After looking over several sources, I've decided to base the layout of the prison mostly on Shroomy's suggestion of Blackmaw Prison from Dungeon 135. The layout is closest to what I had in mind, though I will be changing some of the details.

The lower level just empties into a waste pit, rather than a mine. This prison is much more bleak than the one envisioned in Blackmaw. The prisoners do not get to leave their cells to work; they are left to rot. Sometimes they don't get fed. There is no laundry facility or much of a kitchen.

The prison itself is a repurposed temple from an ancient culture similar to the mayans or aztecs, and as such the outer shape is very pyramid-like, with a long stair leading up to the top (where the outbuildings are), the centre has a hollow shaft where the elevator has been rigged up, though there is also a long, winding stair that goes around the outside of the (now square) shaft.

The cell blocks are similar to that in the module, but only has one row of cells on a given wall, and instead has the second row directly beneath the first. There are stairs at the end of each cell block to gain access. Each cell on the upper level has a grated hole in the floor where the waste from the cell passes through to a hole in the cieling of the cell below, and on through another grated hole in the floor of that cell. That is, assuming nobody is using the hole at the time.

The cell waste holes all exit out into the main waste shaft in the central chamber of the prison complex. The end of the lower cell block halls, where they are closest to the centre have a grated passage leading back into the main waste shaft.

The prison is filthy, humid, and hot at all times, as it is located in the steaming rainforest in a warm subtropical region of the world.

Escape is possible either by fighting through the guards to the surface (more straightforward, but tougher fights), or via the waste pit (disgusting, and more like an old-school dungeon crawl with Traps, Oozes, Undead, and Vermin).

Skill Challenge and a scuffle or two for the initial escape, then a choice and some more fighting and / or exploring.

This is really starting to come together. Thanks again for the help, fellows.

I ran my prison break last night.

The players were able to escape, and they took the way I thought was harder - they fought their way out through wave after wave of guards. They took on a level 7 encounter, even after the Pyromancer had already blown his daily during the initial escape. Nobody even dropped, though the Paladin came pretty close. He was handing out temporary hp like candy though, and his longtooth shifter regen was helping keep him up, as was resist all (wis mod) after spending a surge (from Virtuous Recovery).

The Thief was consistently doing 20-something damage per hit, which was nice; everyone commented on the Thief's damage output. Consistent, and high without being overpowered.

The Pyro-Mage was throwing some nice damage around as well with her cinder wand (she smuggled it in *somehow* ;) ), and got several critical hits in, typically 15-20 +1d8 +1d10, so that really helped as well.

The best part was that because they busted out that way, I still have an evening's worth of adventure for the next time we need to do a one-shot. I was actually hoping they would take the sewers, but I guess that will be for next time.

One more thing that I did was because everyone was without equipment, so as not to make them fall too far behind "expectations," I gave out two boons to each of them.

The Thief had Torog's Lament of the Shackled and Davros' Defensive Step, the Mage had her smuggled wand and also Primal Blessing of Fire, while the Paladin had two item-equivalent boons - one worked like a Cincture of the Dragon Spirit, and the other worked like a Belt of the Brawler.

Overall, we had a pretty good time. It was my first time DMing 4th edition (though I am a 20-year veteran GM with 2e, 3.x, Shadowrun, CoC, and Palladium) and I have to say that I thought it went pretty smoothly. Combat went decently quick, though that was probably at least partly due to only having 3 players, but we got through two at-level fights and one level +3 in the span of an evening, with roleplaying, a skill-challenge to break out, and collecting some spoils of victory.

My next actual campaign that I'll be starting in a few weeks will hopefully go as smoothly, though there will be twice the number of players. Thanks for reading, and comments (et cetera) are welcome.


I didn't, really. I picked things that I thought were fitting with the character's builds and theme so that it was "just part of them."

I ran the second session of this game last weekend. The players decided to finish exploring the temple after having released the prisoners.

They fell down a waste hole and into the sewage and offal. I hammed up the disgusting factor as much as I could.

They discovered an abandoned storage room where there were some barrels, two of which were still unspoiled (one was pickles, the other was some stout). They took their fill and for that I gave them all back a healing surge.

Moving along, they entered an area where the waste pit seemed to empty out into an older part of the temple, which turned out to be a catacomb from when the temple was still being built. Did I mention that it was a temple of the God of Death?

They got ambushed by an Otyugh and two Carrion Crawlers. Everyone got bloodied and the Thief dropped. He was rescued by the Paladin, however.

It was a short session, so that's as far as we got. They're about to do some poking around, I think, and discover an old reliquary with a powerful Mace for the Paladin waiting for them.

From time to time the PCs may find themselves incarcerated. There are plenty of reason why this might be the case, but I think it’s fair to say most PCs will try to escape if the alternative is life imprisonment or execution. How the PCs ended up in prison and what happens to them when they get out is entirely up to the DM. This skill challenge just focuses on scenarios the PCs may find themselves in while incarcerated. This can be run as one large skill challenge or a series of smaller ones.


Setup
The PCs are thrown in prison. They may be looking at hard labour, a life sentence or even execution. Unless they are content to die behind bars, escape is the only option. While imprisoned the PCs are given sub-standard rations and begin suffering form malnourishment and fatigue. If an escape plan is in the works, it should be attempted soon.

Why are the PCs in prison?
The PCs need information from a prisoner. The only way to meet with him face-to-face is to get thrown in prison along side of him. The PCs may pretend to be known criminals or may deliberately commit a crime in order to be thrown in prison.
The PCs have been framed for a crime they did not commit. The accusations are false, the evidence planted and the magistrate bribed. They have no chance of beating the rap honestly.
The PCs are guilty. Whether they knowing committed a criminal offensive (with good reason of course) or whether they unknowingly broke a law they were not aware of, they have ended up in prison.
Complexity
If this is run as one large skill challenge it should be a complexity 4 or 5. However, this might work better as a series of smaller complexity 1 skill challenges.

Primary Skills
Athletics, Acrobatics, Bluff, Endurance, Heal, History, Stealth, Streetwise, Thievery

Each skill can only be used to accomplish 1 success towards the overall skill challenge unless noted otherwise.
Skill checks denoted as assist do not count as a success or failure towards the overall skill challenge.
Other skills
Diplomacy, Insight, Perception

Inside the Prison
Acrobatics (hard DC)
Tumble gracefully from a balcony to gain access to a restricted area.

Athletics (moderate DC)
Climb over a wall to gain access to a restricted area.

Diplomacy (moderate DC, assist)
Earn favour with guards or other prisoners to gain information about the prison or guards.

Success: +2 to Streetwise or History.

Insight (moderate DC, assist)
Ferret out sympathetic guards and prisoners.

Success: +2 to Bluff check.

Intimidate (moderate DC)
Show strength in the face of a challenge to earn respect of fellow inmates.

Streetwise (easy DC)
Learn who the power players are in the prison – inmates and hacks.

Streetwise (medium DC)
Learn about the prison layout.

Streetwise (hard DC)
Learn the most likely location of weapons and equipment.

Thievery (hard DC)
Create improvised thieves tools from common items found in the prison.

Escaping Your Cell
Bluff (hard DC)
Fake illness convincing the guards to come into your cell.

Endurance (hard DC)
Keep up your strength despite harsh conditions and poor food.

Heal (moderate DC)
Fight off infection or disease due to poor conditions and rotten food.

Insight (moderate DC, assist)
Ferret out sympathetic guards.

Success: +2 to Bluff check.

Perception (moderate DC, assist)
You act as the look out while attempting to escape from your cell.

Success: +2 to ally’s Stealth check.

Thievery (hard DC)
Pick the lock of the cell. The PC must have some kind of tools, even if improvised.

Escaping the Prison
Acrobatics (hard DC)
Tumble gracefully from a balcony to gain access to a restricted area.

Athletics (moderate DC)
Climb over a wall to gain access to a restricted area.

Athletics (hard DC)
Climb over the wall to escape the prison grounds.

History (moderate DC, maximum 2 successes)
Recall or learn something useful about the layout of the prison.

Perception (moderate DC, assist)
You act as the look out for anyone sneaking around the prison or climbing the wall.

Success: +2 to ally’s Stealth check.

Stealth (moderate DC)
Move about the prison without detection.

Stealth (hard DC)
Avoid detection in the yard.

Success
The PCs manage to break out of prison undetected. Which is not to say that they won’t be missed. They have a limited amount of time to put distance between themselves and the prison, but for now no one is looking for them.

Failure
The PCs are either caught before they escape the prison or manage to just make it out when they are detected. If they are caught before they escape then they will face severe punishment and most likely be moved to a more secure area (making future escape attempts more difficult). If they do manage to make it over the wall, they are spotted during the escape. Guards will be after them immediately. The chase is on.

The strange case of Dead Goats 

Here's space to develop Black Jay (and his dead sheep issue) from the ToEE PC game into a workable side-quest for those running the pen-and-paper module.

As the quest stands in the PC game, there's a bit of investigation, a bit of Fedex quest (take item A to NPC B), and a bit of roleplaying interaction. Not bad, to start. As I see it:

A) Black Jay has a problem. This could be mentioned by another NPC in passing, or there could be someone who's concerned about him that actively seeks the PCs out (once they've established themselves as the "resident problem-solvers").

B) Speaking to Black Jay will initially elicit a negative response, likely of the "get off my land" variety, unless they have established a reputation for good in the village; however, with some convincing (a bottle or two from the brewery would help), he will reveal that his sheep have been dying off. They have no visible marks on them, they are simply found dead. If asked, he will say that, while he is far from popular in the village, he doesn't have any enemies that he's aware of. As a matter of fact, Jay's quite a gloomy guy, and if pressed will admit he suspects the gods are simply punishing him for leaving his wife and child to fight in the war. He will not ask the PCs to help, but will gruffly thank them for the effort should they announce their intentions to do so.

C) Investigating the field will turn up half-chewed hemlock sprigs lying here and there. Only a druid or ranger character (or possibly a sylvan elf, if no nature-related PC is present) is likely to recognize these as poisonous, unless they have some special background in herbalism. However, they have clearly been left here on purpose; the stems have been cut, and hemlock doesn't grow anywhere near the field.

D) If necessary, taking the sprigs to Jaroo will identify them as poisonous hemlock, and deeply disturb Jaroo, as well. (Solving this quest, I feel, should generate goodwill with Jaroo.) He will urge the PCs to stop whoever is poisoning Black Jay's sheep.

E) Hiding in or near the field at night (shouldn't really require a hide roll if the PCs use common sense in hiding themselves), the PCs will see Corl (the teamster's son) dropping hemlock in the field. If he is confronted he will run. If caught, he will confess to poisoning the sheep, and with some cajoling (or threats) will reveal that he did it to protect his family; no amount of convincing (short of some serious CE-style torture) will get him to reveal who put him up to it. (Use your judgement, here, see below if he cracks.) Regardless, being caught will scare Corl enough to prevent him from doing it again - problem solved (for Jay, at least).

F) Confronting Corl at his family's residence will elicit a negative reaction from his father - unless the PCs have found out exactly who talked Corl into it. (See below.) He doesn't take well to any outsiders coming and making accusations against his son.

G) Bringing the evidence to Black Jay and telling him what happened will relieve him greatly, and earn the PCs a (somewhat tactiturn) friend. He will not pursue vengeance against Corl, and will discourage the PCs from doing so; he is simply glad it won't be happening again.

The background behind this (which will more than likely not come out unless the PCs really dig) is that Black Jay is an elf-friend and a veteran of Emridy Meadows, and the traders (Rannos & Gremag) are temple spies. Suspecting that Jay could call on the elves for assistance should the village be attacked, they plan to drive him out of Hommlet, without a confrontation if possible.

To this end, they have intimidated Corl into doing their dirty work with threats of violence against his family. Corl will go to great lengths to conceal this, even after being caught, for fear of reprisal. PCs who follow Corl around after catching him in the act (or who hang around the traders' place) may catch a glimpse of Gremag and Corl having a rather heated exchange behind the trading post. Anyone successfully eavesdropping will hear a snatch of conversation: "... didn't tell them anything!" "You better not have, or..." (Adjust to taste.) Approaching the two will only result in Corl clamming up, and Gremag claiming that he found Corl messing with his horse stock, and was giving him a "good talking to." A week later, Corl will turn up dead in Nulb, with a poisoned dagger wound in him. (The braumeister's apprentice will be able to identify him, although he won't likely volunteer this information.) As usual, approaching the traders about this will not impress them, but will definitely get the PCs "on the list" with these two. For that matter, the teamster is likely to blame the PCs for the death of his son, should it come to his attention (he will assume that Corl has just run off, otherwise).

The restless war of Honor 
-----

EMRIDY MEADOWS
the river can simply be a branch of the Veldrdyva south of the main river, since the CRPG has Emridy Meadows about 5 leagues north of Hommlet, a far more convenient distance. I would locate it where the word 'Verbobonc' is on this map:
http://www.thekeep.org/~wombat/RTTTOEE ... e_hex.jpg

Vanquished Knights of Veluna (30), AL LN, MV 12", HD 1, AC 7, #AT 1, D 1-6, SA nil, SD half damage from piercing/slashing attacks, no effect from enchantments, charms, and cold attacks, holy water does 2-8 damage, SZ M, IN Average

Mavis Dabro, Leader of the Vanquished, AL LN, MV 12", HD 2, AC 5, #AT 1, D 1-6, SA nil, SD half damage from piercing/slashing attacks, no effect from enchantments, charms, and cold attacks, holy water does 2-8 damage, SZ M, IN Average

Skeletal Horses (31), AL N, MV 15", HD 2, AC 7, #AT 2, D 1-6/1-6, SA nil, SD half damage from piercing/slashing attacks, no effect from enchantments, charms, and cold attacks, holy water does 2-8 damage, SZ M, IN Animal

Mavis Dabro was an experienced and decorated commander from a noble, but impoverished aristocratic Velunan family. He never doubted his limits, until the Battle of Emridy Meadows, when he had a moment of weakness, panicked, and led his men in retreat to the river, where they died an ignoble death. Cursed to relive their moment of shame, he and his men can only be freed when they succeed in death as they did not in life. The problem is, Dabro's sword was lost in the waters of the river, and without it he has not had the confidence to properly lead his men against the opposing forces. In particular, he needs to know that Heironeous favors him, and will allow him a proper rest in the afterlife. Anyone who can return his sword, bless it on the delapidated battlefield altar, and give it to him, and then ensure he wins against the enemy will allow him and his men eternal rest. Although they retain the intelligence they have in life, they cannot speak without the aid of a speak with dead spell. They start out with a negative attitude towards intruders, but will not attack at first, waiting to be convinced. If the attitude is turned to Friendly or better, they stand around the party, attempting to speak. If the attitude is Enthuseastic, one of them, Mavis, walks to the river, pointing to the waters. If able to speak, Mavis will only explain what he wants, without embellishment, unless the attitude it Enthuseastic.

The sword is guarded by a few zombies of the other cavalry, who easily rebuff any efforts by the lighter skeletal forces to recover it. The altar is hallowed, and neither side can get close to it. Any approach to the river by anyone is met with force from Velash's men, at least 2 zombies per intruder.

Dabros and his men have been active since the first day of Growfest, when Harmony Truth tried speaking with dead with the opposing side. She has not tried speaking with the Velunans yet. Each night at midnight, they rise out of the waters of the river, and return to the battlefield, except for Mavis Dabro who futily tries to locate his sword, only to be frustrated by the zombies. After about an hour of this, a skeletal Velunan warns Mavis, and he returns to his men, who have been waiting patiently mounted up the whole time. They get in formation and meet the forces of Velash Fennin in battle. At dawn, the transparent ghostly flesh boils from their bones as they return to the river.


Restless Chargers of the Temple (24), AL NE, MV 6", HD 2, AC 8, #AT 1, D 1-8, SA nil, no effect from enchantments, charms, and cold attacks, holy water does 2-8 damage, SZ M, IN Average

Velash Fennin, Leader of the Restless, AL CE, MV 12", HD 3, AC 6, #AT 1, D 1-8, SA nil, SD no effect from enchantments, charms, and cold attacks, holy water does 2-8 damage, SZ M, IN Average

Zombie Horses (25), AL N, MV 12", HD 3, AC 8, #AT 2, D 1-8/1-8, SA nil, SD no effect from enchantments, charms, and cold attacks, holy water does 2-8 damage, SZ M, IN Animal

* note, all damage taken by one side inflicted by the other side is automatically restored at midnight of the full moon of either Luna or Celene. Damage taken from other sources is not healed in this way. As a general rule, the undead mounts do not attack on their own, but can be directed to by their rider in place of the rider's regular attack (it takes a bit of effort).

Velash Fennin was all guts n'glory, which is the reason he and his men are here still. Seeing a contingent of Veluna knights routing, he charged recklessly. They ended up impaled on stakes, and possbily responsible for the defeat of the forces of Evil. Needless to say, the men hold Fennin responsible, a position he is uncomfortable with. Velash's undead forces are hard to control, and tend to disobey him out of spite. They have been active ever since the priestess Harmony Truth arrived a week ago at the start of Growfest. Each night they rise up, at midnight of the full moon. They wander around a bit, unless Harmony tries to speak with them, and a few always wander down to the river to keep the Dabro from doing whatever it is he wants to do down by the river (they do not know). After about an hour, they gather up their mounts, mount up, and attack the Velunan forces (it is something they feel compelled to do). They clash until daylight, then dig their way into their shallow graves again.

Hedrack's mission team
Harmony Truth, fH CE Cleric 5
Low acolyte Lew, mH NE Cleric 2
Temple Guards, human NE fighters 1(4)
'Jelly', a bugbear guard for Harmony Truth

Harmony Truth puts the evil in chaotic evil. She wants Terjon's amulet to score points back at the temple, and considers it a neccessity to haul back Velash Fennin and his 'men'. She is peeved that these particular undead are being so recalcitrant, unwilling to believe that she can't command them. She suspects Lew of being less than dedicated to the mayhem and carnage she can't seem to live without, and deems him weaker for it. She will see any attempt to interfere with the battlefield at Emridy Meadows as an attempt to steal her glory. She is crafty, however, and will seek to have any intruders destroy Mavis Dabro and his forces, possibly by representing herself as a cleric of Hieroneous from Veluna here to put rest the undead.

Lew thinks that Harmony Truth puts the stupid in chaotic stupid, and thinks of himself as a man able to seize opportunities. He will therefore seize any opportunity to sell out Harmony, and march back with any prizes to Hedrack. He won't do anything to risk his life without appropriate gain, however.

Jelly, so named because of what his maul does to the heads of opponents, and for the fact that he repeatedly sits on his food until it turns the right 'consistency' (he has a sensitive teeth). He is none too bright, but if anyone can fix his dental problem, they have a loyal, if evil, follower. Jelly will cause more problems than he solves, though.

The fighters as selfish men who think of coins first, last, and always. They probably dream of retiring rich, surrounded by women and luxury. In truth they are cannon fodder sitting in a battlefield for the last week, eating iron rations and digging a new latrine for Jelly.

Terjon's artifact is located under a rainbow colored stone between the two armies. During the day, Harmony Truth will likely object to the idea of someone looking around the middle of the battlefield. At night, there will probably be a ghostly battle going on. Underneath the rock is a note to Terjon from his father, and an artifact.*

* I have not had a chance to redo this portion of the CRPG, so if anyone can fill in on the contents of the note and the nature of the artifact, please do!

OTHER ADVENTURES:
I think that a regular party of 4-6 adventurers without a number of hirelings or NPCs really should be 2-3rd level before hitting the Moathouse. The CRPG gives some other side quests that can be done before then, including clearing out a Deklo grove 5 miles north of Hommlet for the woodcutter, finding out who is killing Black Jay's sheep, etc. It would be nice to put these up as well. If I have time, I might do so. I think that giving the party some experience prior to the Moathouse is something most, if not all, DMs of T1-4 have struggled with.
--
Damn! I scribble a few notes, you just up and run with it. Fantastic information, good NPCs, excellent back story. I like Hedrack's team a lot.

I haven't given much thought to Terjon, his amulet, or the note. I can't recall what it said in the CRPG, and frankly, what's been spelled out here is far superior.

How about this -
If the party is successful in recovering the sword, and bringing peace to the velunan cowards, there'll be a brief moment where the departing souls can be asked about the battle field, without the aid or limitation of Speak with Dead.

The amulet could be a reliquary of some cuthbert saint, which was torn from Terjon's breast in the heat of battle. (I believe the CRPG was just a personal gift from Terjon's father)

The Velunans know where Terjon fought, and can indicate the general area. A Detect Good or Detect Magic might locate the reliquary if the players have a more specific area to search (or is just lucky), but the information gathered from the knights would be invaluable for pin-pointing the object.

Labour Problems 
--
So one of the quests from CRPG is a problem that Burne & Rufus are having where there are several unexplained construction delays due to issues with supplies being mis-ordered/misplaced.

This is probably the weakest quest in the game. It's essentially a click the right thing type of quest, and the premise is so flimsy that it's almost laughable. Nevertheless, I really like the backdrop - Temple agents harassing the efforts to create a stronghold in hommlett.

So I've given a lot of thought to how to make this work. Burne is a magic user, so any magic interference would have to be indirect, and very subtle.

Here are the cast of characters for this little mystery:
The agent: he's a part of the workgang, but not on the payroll. He's an illusionist, and has bribed one of the foreman to keep him on.
The foreman: Not evil, just stupid. He's taken a large bribe to let some guy hang out and snoop around.
The Jeweler: He's got a revealing clue about the foreman.
The Traders: They're at the nest of this little problem.
The Courier: ???? - I'd like to get this guy involved as an alternate means of solving the mystery, in case tracking down the illusionist is too difficult for the players.

[NOTE: I actually run a Castles & Crusades Game. I post here, because I figure you grognards would have more insight, so if I mention some spell or effect that's not exactly in the PH or UA, you'll have to figure out how to make it work]

Initially, it's very difficult to point out the agent in the work camp. He's very subtley involved, intelligent, and a spellcaster.

The clues I have used are:
The foreman (bribed guy) has a really fancy belt buckle. It's new if you ask around. He bought it from the jeweler. He's a good foreman, fair, kind of single-minded, but not unlikeable. It never occurs to him to hide the fact that he didn't earn the gold in a legitimate way, but he's smart enough to not offer the information that he's allowed a spy in the work camp.

The jeweler knows that the foreman paid for the buckle with gold. A large sum of gold. Laborers, even the foreman, get paid in silver.

A night at the Welcome Wench where service is bad - just after payday, the laborers are carousing, throwing their silver around like it's going out of style.

Only a few of the foreman are literate.

Shipments are either completely wrong or missing key materials.

-= Mystery Parameters =-
Can't use overt magic.
It must be involved enough that Burne (as co-magistrate) cannot direct his personal efforts to solve.
Implicates the Traders.

I'm looking for my notes. IIRC, the mystery involves modifying the orders with illusory script and undetectable aura, which lasts long enough for the orders to arrive incorrectly at their destination, but seem normal when it's time to review the order in Hommlet.

The courier probably meets the illusionist just outside the town.

One of the difficulties with this little plot is that it can confuse players into leaving the area entirely to chase red herrings in Veluna or Verbobonc.

Ok, I'll write more later.

Woodsman Problems 
---

I intro-ed this is my Hackmaster game as follows:

[Please note that the Guardians of the Polar Bear consists of 2 guys (mid 20's), my wife (31) and two daughters (10 & 8 ), so romanantic themes, while not common, sometime occur.]

The Farmer's daughter (Melanie) has disappeared. She likes to play in the assorted wooded areas around Hommlett (she's an aspiring Druid, a career path her father does not appreciate). At the same time, the woodcutter shows up complaining about a spider infestation in the old Deklo grove. even the denseest PCs should be able to put two and two together...:)

I believe that I had 3 large spiders in the grove maybe 4 (it has been over a year!)...in AD&D that would be:

AC 8, MV 6"/15", HD 1+1, #ATT 1, DMG 1, SA Poison (+2 to save), AL NT.

A good solution would be to drive the spiders away or use Ranger/Druidic powers to do the same. My group being my group they opted for slaughter! :? My wife, a 1/2-elven Cleric/Ranger of Ehlonna, rationalized it as, "Well, spiders are the servants of the Dark One Whose Name We Do Not Utter." (Brian Blume?) My 10 year old daughter, the elven Prinncess (fighter specialized in long bow--hey, she maxed out her Social Class Roll!) agreed, which is ironic since she would later take out Lareth (who I turned into a Drow) single-handedly.

Melanie is bound in a cocoon in a web, weakened from poison. The spiders attack (if not handled otherwise) and hopefully are killed without too much problems.

Complications: Melanie (age 16) could possibly develop a crush on a handsome (or not so handsome) male PC. [Not a problem in my game...the male PCs were a gnome fighter/illusionist and a dwarf fighter!] Alternatively, she might seek the counsel or mentoring of a PC druid...even though Ehlonna and the Shalm are usually at odds, she did ask my wife's advice about what to do...something my wife handled well in character.

The experience is enough to send the 0-lvl Melanie over the cusp into !st level Druid. She leaves her family and spends some time with Jaroo who undertsnads the call of the Shalm. Handled corectly (and if the party looks halfway competant), Jaroo might send her with the party later on...

That's my take on it, anyway.

EDIT: I almost forget...I had the PCs find a descicatted (sp?) elf body in rotted leather armor...and a pouch containing 10 gp, 1 ruby worth 250).

The farmer, while wealthy, does not have a lot of hard currency. He'll throw a big feast in the players' favor n a couple of nights. That's when Melanie announces she's going to the Jaroo's grove. Ane

Goblin Infestede Lovers Nest 

We've been tossing around ideas for ToEE sidequests, with great results so far (I'd say), but one thing that most of them don't address is gold. Hard cash. Moolah. If you're using training costs, this is gonna be an issue. Part of the answer may just be using a detailed wilderness map, with monster lairs linked to random encounters (maybe a 5 or 10% chance of stumbling across one on every trip through the hex, if you don't go looking?), but I'm working up a "starter dungeon" that's nearby, relatively survivable for a small-to-medium party of 1st-level characters. Figured I'd share my notes here.

The premise I'm starting with is that Hommlet lies just on the edge of the Kron Hills. Depending on what version of Greyhawk/Viscounty of Verbobonc geography you subscribe to, this may or may not work for you, so feel free to adjust as necessary. I'm supposing that there are plenty of abandoned gnomish structures and excavations dotting the hills, some of them with nasty new inhabitants, not to mention all manner of natural caves and bolt holes.

This one is a ruined silver mining outpost (long ago worked out and abandoned) cresting the top of a wooded hill not more than a mile or two from Hommlet. The above-ground portion consists of little more than a few low walls standing perpendicular to each other, the roof having long since fallen in and many of the stones carted away to build farmhouse foundations. The stair down to the below-ground levels is plugged up with debris, and the site has been somewhat of a "lovers' rendezvous" for most of the village's existence.

However, what isn't common knowledge is that the original excavation connected up with a natural cave complex, the mouth of which is in a gully at the foot of the hill. This houses a tiny ecosystem of its own; with rainwater washing dead organic matter from the surface down through the caves, they support a thriving fungal and insect population, which in turn supports a few successful predators. Recently a small band of hobgoblins, exiled from a tribe in the Gnarley Forest, have taken up residence here. They figure the village to be easy pickings, and plan on living well off stolen livestock (supplemented by the occasional far-ranging shepherd). They are taking great pains to stay concealed, but have failed to take into consideration humans' need for privacy when attending to reproductive matters - they were recently spotted leaving the cave by a young couple (who immediately called off their tryst and fled back to the village by another route).

Normally, their first reaction would be to alert one of Burne's Badgers (the town militia) and let them take care of it. However, the lovers are in a bit of a bind: Their families are of different religious persuasions (St. Cuthbert and the Old Faith, respectively), and they have been forbidden to see each other. They can't bring this to the attention of the authorities without questions coming up as to what they were doing at the ruins, and they are already sure that the girl's parents suspect something. (Her father is quite zealous in his devotion to St. Cuthbert, keeping a stout oaken cudgel hung over the cottage door, and has informed the young lad that it would be put to good use on his skull should he catch him near his daughter again.)

This has weighed heavily on the lovers, and the lad has taken to hanging around the Welcome Wench, in the hopes he can find a group of outsiders to take care of the hobgoblins without making the affair public. He will observe any newcomers from across the public room, and if they appear to be likely prospects (any armed group will do, he's getting desperate), he will approach them with his tale. He is most insistent that the PCs need not involve the authorities in the matter, but will offer to lead them to the site and point out the cave entrance.


I haven't worked out the exact identities of the lovers, yet, I'll edit that in once I figure it out. I'll post the basic description of the cave complex and its inhabitants in a few, and the worked dungeon level after that.
--
Ran this on Saturday - lots of fun.

Playing the part of the young lovers, we had Jacen (the otherwise unidentified son of the farmer in area 25), and Danielle (one of the unidentified "seven children" of the cowherd at area 21).

The dungeon itself, I have presented Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style - the physical layout doesn't matter much, just as long as the tunnels connecting caverns are believably long. (This is the first handful of rooms, more to follow. "#" references with no number aren't described, yet.)

#1. The entrance to the cavern is a moderately steep, rocky climb about seven feet down from the bottom of the gully. (Any healthy individual can make this with ease.) Climbers will have to duck low to gain entrance, but after this the tunnel opens up and normal-sized humans should have no problem walking two abreast. (All passages are 10' wide, unless otherwise noted.)

30' in, a small (5' wide) tunnel opens to the left (#2), while the wall on the right drops off 15' to reveal a large (roughly 30x80), kidney-shaped grotto (#3); the path hugs a ledge on the left-hand wall, gradually sloping down to meet the floor.

#2. This passage terminates at a round chamber, 20' across. Two al-mir'aj (a mated pair) lair in cracks in the walls here; one will be visible when the PCs arrive. It will pace nervously for a moment when they enter, and will spring to attack if they do not leave within a few seconds. Its mate will attack from hiding on the next round. Their lair contains no treasure.

#3. Dead organic material, soil and water wash down into this cavern when it rains, making it a perfect place for life to thrive. All manner of (non-monstrous) insects and fungi can be found in this grotto. A slight bioluminescent glow can be detected if light sources are extinguished, but it is not enough for humans to see by. The grotto narrows at its far end, leading to a t-shaped junction (#4).

#4. The passage here leads to the left (#5) and to the right (#), at a slight downward slope in both directions. A crawl that opens up directly overhead leads to the pedipalps' lair (#), but PCs will not notice this unless they look directly upwards. Roll for a random encounter here, if one is indicated, it will be with one of the pedipalps.

#5. The passage here splits, leading left (#6) (at a slight upward incline) and right (#7) at a gradual downward slope.

#6. This dome-shaped cavern is about sixty feet across. The floor is dry (as water does not flow into this area), but teems with insects. The insects will swarm over the legs of anyone passing through this area; anyone passing through has a 1 in 6 chance of being bitten (with a 5% chance of contracting a disease). Two fire beetles lair here. (Remove from random encounter table if defeated). There are no exits other than the tunnel that leads here.

#7 The passage here flares out to an oval chamber, about 40' long and 20' wide at the middle. The chamber floor is flooded to a depth of two feet, with only a narrow ledge around the perimeter should one wish to stay dry. The water is foul and brackish, thick with scum and nearly completely opaque. Anyone looking at the ceiling will see several shiny, grey lumps with yellow spots clinging over the pool. PCs hugging the ledge will be safe, but those wading through the water will be attacked by 10 scum creepers; these will drop as PCs pass underneath (1d6 per round, randomize attacks between all characters in the water). Searching the water for 3 turns will turn up a rotten, slimy corpse; further searching in the area of the body will turn up a lantern (will need to be thoroughly dried before it will work), 6 cp, 17 sp, 4 gp, a rusted short sword (-2 to hit, breaks the first time it hits armor) and several handfuls worth of rusted iron rings (what is left of a ring mail jack after the leather backing rotted away). The passage continues on 40' to the next large chamber (#8).

#8 This expansive, peanut-shaped cavern is home to a small "grove" of mushroom stalks. (The stalks themselves are just over man-high, the thickness of a large man's thigh, and very tough; however, the caps will not support any weight over 50 pounds, so they are not easily scaled.) The tunnel from #7 connects with the west end of the "peanut," which holds the thickest grouping of mushrooms, along with a shallow pool of brackish water. A passage exits the cavern in the middle (or "waist") of the peanut, leading to the south and immediately forking southeast and southwest (to #9 and #10, respectively). Towards the east end of the peanut, a iron-bound door is set into the north wall of the cavern. The door is approximately 5 feet hight, and nearly that wide. (This is gnomish construction, after all.) What appears to be a lock is nothing more than an arrow trap; anyone opening the door without first disarming the trap will set it off and take 1d6 points of damage (save vs. breath weapon to avoid). The door opens inwards (push from this side), and is stuck, but not locked or barred. 20 feet to the east is the body of a hobgoblin, recently deceased. Anyone examining the body closely will have a 5% chance to notice something moving in the right eye socket: a fat rot grub. Anyone searching (or attempting to strip) the body will have a 50% chance of feeling a cold, wriggling sensation on the back of their hand, as one of several grubs infesting this body burrows into it. The body has 11 cp and 4 gp in a pouch at its waist. (The other hobgoblins know what killed their compatriot, and won't come anywhere near the body, so the coins, weapons (longsword and dagger), and armor (scale mail and shield) are all still here.)

Random Encounters:

1 1d3 cave crickets
2 2d4+2 giant rats
3 1d4-2 pedipalps
4 d6+4 stirges
5 1d2 fire beetles
6 3d10 bats (no combat, but rushing by will extinguish torches)

Mage scroll 
Whirling Blade

Lvl:            4
Range:          0
Components:     V, S
Duration:       10s / level
Casting Time:   2 s
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw:   None

This spell creates a shimmering, translucent silvery blade of force equal in dimensions and damage to a long sword. 
It orbits one of the caster's hands and strikes once per round as a magical weapon (+1 to ATK and DMG).

The blade is weightless, and passes through metallic things as though they did not exist, without affecting them.

Metal armor is discounted when determining armor class against blade attacks; i.e. targets receive dexterity 
and magical bonuses, but not metal shield and mail protection, creatures with naturally tough hides or natural 
armor plating have their usual armor classes!

A whirling blade also passes through the body of its caster without harm the caster is never imperilled by his own
weapon. The blade cannot break, but is destroyed instantly by contact with a Arcane Wall.

A whirling blade emits a continuous, high-pitched shrieking noise and vibrations of magical force that cannot be magically
silenced and therefore cannot be used with any measure of stealth. 
Note that the caster can hold or carry normal weapons and other inorganic objects in the hand wieleding the whirling blade 
without hampering its functioning, unless the carried objects are so large as to obstruct the caster's view of foes, or so 
heavy (10 pounds or more) as to hamper or significantly slow arm movement. 

This magical weapon exists for the duration given or until the caster concentrates on casting another spell, whereupon it vanishes. 
Wielding and actively using a weapon also disrupts the spell, canceling its effects prematurely.

A dwarf sized ring mail [B:65 SP, S: 50SP]


---

Missjudged, the power of the Elfin mail, it is going to be an expensive endavour. 
As it is a chain mail, with only a -1 defense modifier. Making it just slightly worse 
than a +3 Leather armor. 

Priset är 5*En vanlig Chain mail = 1 000 SP = 100 GP 

It is not quite as expensive as one might think, the reason being that I would judge the problem
to be more of finding an elf capable of creating one, the processes is going to take 3 months to complete. 
Potentially it could be done sooner but at an increased prices. Take the amount of time reduction and multiply the price, 
to a minimum of 1 month. 

Ex. 3->1 month = 1/3 => 1000 * 3 = 3000 SP

*******
The Dragon Egg 
A seemingly teardrop shaped saphire like jewel 

Any Lore checks leaves the investigator puzzled about its origins and purpose

But through experimentations one notices that it can absorb SP and when done so it will produce water. 

Small Cost will produce one pitchers worth of perferctly pure and clear drinking water. That seemingly begins to drip from the Jewel. 

After recieving a certain amount of SP a new ability will be unlocked 
The user can now shot out the water out to 20ft away but at the current moment is little more than a Squirt Gun.

After another threshold
The user can now fire out water to the level of a strong garden hose, not dangerous so far.

After another threshold
The user can now fire out compressed burst of water, dealing unarmed damage (d4-2)+(d4-2) + 2 up to a range of 20ft 

After another threshold
Damage increased to 2d4+2 


After another threshold
The water is now like a fire hose requireing the user to be able to withstand the pushback
It deals a good amount of damage at a range capable of chanign target to attack multiple enemies at a time. 


The Jewel is actually a dragon egg waiting to recieve enough SP before it is able to hatch, and will in turn empower it current holder to insentivce it continued useage.

Amulet of Proof Against Turning
Ming
A bronze pendant of the sun being eclipsed by the moon. The pendant confers immunity to being turned or controlled. May be used by any person/creature subject to turning (i.e. undead, paladins, etc.) Useful also for a mage that has created undead and wishes to keep a priest from wresting away control. It must be worn by the creature/person that it will affect. The evil mage Ming is suspected of working on a version to be worn by a spellcaster to simultaneously protect any undead he has raised.
--

Amber Spider
Ming
A small polished piece of amber with a spider trapped inside, held in a silver web pendant. The wearer of this pendant cannot be trapped in spider webs or web spells, and can climb across them at � movement rate. 10% of these also allow the casting of a spider climb spell 1/day.
--

Alarm Wire
Ming
A spool of fine copper wire on a wooden plug. When a piece of wire is snipped off and straightened, it may be placed across a hallway, windowsill, etc. and has the same effect when crossed over as an alarm spell. Each piece will function only once. An unused spool has 50 feet of wire.
--

Bag of Thorns
Ming
Inside this small, roughly woven raw silk bag is 4d20 long, sharp thorns. If a thorn is planted in the ground, one round later a 5 feet diameter by 8 feet high wickedly barbed thicket will sprout. If two thorns are planted within 10 feet of each other, a 10 feet wide by 10 feet high by 3 feet thick hedge will grow. In this manner a wall, square, or other shaped hedge of nasty thorns can be created. Brushing against the hedge causes 1 point of damage, and any who try to pass through the hedge suffer 1d6 points of damage per foot, moving at only one foot per round, destroying clothing and damaging leather in the process. Size small creatures may subtract 1 point of damage per die, and size tiny creatures suffer only half damage. Chopping through the brush takes one round per foot; setting fire requires one round to light, then burns away a 5 feet section per round. Dispel magic can destroy the wall. If left alone, the thorn bushes will grow naturally at a rate of 1 foot per month in all directions, never to exceed double its original size.

Book of Spelling Mistakes by Juliet Wright
This book detects as magic but appears to be a dull non-fiction book describing some feature of the current location. When read by a spell caster the reader immediately gets a headache and double vision for d6+3 turns. Thereafter the spell caster is subject to spelling mistakes in his spells at the rate of d6 per day. These take the form of single letter changes to the spell's name (and hence effects). So for Sleep read Sheep or Steep or Sleet. Initially the DM will make the substitutions and the player will only find out the effects when casting the spell (DMs must be generous!).

If a spell has no valid one-letter transformation it cannot be affected. After a week the player gains the ability to select the spelling mistakes and so to create some potentially powerful new spells (the DM still selects the effects though in line with the new spell title). This item gives lots of opportunity for fun and creativity among players and DMs (I never could persuade anyone to take "Piss Without Trace").

The DM can opt to allow a Remove Curse or more powerful equivalent to remove the effect at his discretion but I find that after a while other players are envious.

Borgir�s Sugar Cubes
Ming
Ordinary looking sugar cubes except that they are individually wrapped in mint leaves. Each cube heals 1d3 points of damage or will cure minor illnesses like dysentery, flu, colic, etc. Originally created for Borgir�s large herd of horses, these cubes are fairly common in and around southern Harkmoor. Usually found in a box of 5-20. These may be dissolved in liquid and are often dropped in brackish water to make it drinkable (1 gallon per cube).
--

Bowl of Purity
Ming
A common-looking wooden bowl (made of wood from a sacred grove) with a blessing for health and plenty carved along the inside edge in ancient Ersic. Any food or liquid placed in this bowl, whether rancid or poisoned, is made edible as per the spell purify food and drink.

The contents of the bag will be whatever the last owner of the box had in his possession (clothing, carried wealth, weapons, magic items). Determine the conents of the bag randomly as you see fit.

Thereafter, or if the box is discovered empty, one time per week reaching into the box will randomly produce something delightful. An Identify will reveal this sole property to the caster. A second Identify will show the nature of the two greatest delights the box has to offer (money and magic). A final Identify is required to reveal the one function of the box which will most certainly delight other people!

Kidnapper�s Bag
Ming
This is a coarse black sack with a drawstring. When placed over a person�s head, he must save vs. paralyzation or be rendered unconscious immediately, lasting 2d4 rounds. To use this item on an unwilling victim, a called shot to the head (at -4 to hit) must be rolled. This modifier can be negated if attacking from with surprise, or if the victim is held or sleeping. Once a victim has passed the saving throw, the bag will not function against that person again. The bag is big enough to be used against size large creatures like ogres.

Og's unbreakable orb
Bubb A. Geddon
This is a sphere about 5" in diameter made of a pale, dull and unidentifiable gray non-metallic substance. It weighs approximately 7 lbs. It is not affected by any form of attack, any form of elemental damage or ANY form of magic (regardless of the caster level). It cannot be crushed, gouged, scratched or ground. It is non-conductive and non magnetic. It cannot be heated or cooled. wish and alter reality magic will not undo it. In short: its one property is that is affected by no force but simple physics. It can be thrown, carried, dropped, rolled etc. If thrown it will strike for 1d6 (strength bonuses apply).

The abomination uses stats similar to an Ooze. 
By that I mean that it has a lot of health, tought not all that much DR, like the normal Zombie. 
As well as if damaged enough by a cutting weapon it will start to split apart, each part being able to move by its self. 
It is capable to grab Number of PC's - 2 at the same time. And is able to bite multiple victims at once. 
Its bite is highly contaigouse with the zombie virus
Requiring victims do performs saves against the virus after each instance of an attack that draws blood. 
If it can successfully grab an victim and bite down. It will also be able to transfer rotgrubs into the victim.

HP  : 4

DR  : (Look at Barksin)
- Weak to Hacking and Fire damage, to the point of instant death if damaged by such a source
- Small DR against Crushing 
- DR against Piercing 


Mosquito vision, able to find and discern heat sources, looking to find juicy blood bags. 

Skills 
Perception : 40
Sneaking 30 (+20 in natural terrian) 
Hiding whilst in hiding it is indistinguishable from a dead shrub. 


Intelligence is very low, acting mostly on instinct. 
But it instinct does tell it to look to attack sleeping foes, which i is able to determine from the heat and oxygen given of from its target. 
Otherwise it fights until death, it can be turned as if an undead Will factor 2.

If its corpse is investigated a check will reveal that in its head there is what looks like a fang like human tooth. 

Any damage it deals leave some splinters in the targets wound. 
A (Average) First aid check is needed to remove it. 
A non crit-failed check deals the recipient 1 damage ignore DR as the splinter is removed forcefully
A crit-fail, causes some part of the splinter to remain in the wound and can lead to future complications.

This area does not contain a lot of powerful items, instead this is were some slaves can be found on behalf of Hlevtagnis, some tortured adventures, random people from the streets. 
Some fenced and smuggled goods. Very small amounts of it is in actual cash and most of it will require access to a fencer to handle properly.

Skullport

Luften är tjock, unken och lätt fuktig. Påminner om att gå in i en grotta med en underjordisk sjö eller en möglig källare. 
På allt trä som används för att sätta upp husen kan man see grön-grå aktigt slime mossa, denna mossa täcker även stora delar av vägarna och är väldigt hala som att gå på fallna och blöta löv. 

Inga blommar är synliga, de enda växtligheten som man kan see är denna mossa samt några enstaka svampar.

Don and Hans are not real members of the Xhanatar Guild, they are simply somewhat low level thugs. 
Something which Don finds himself in but Hans has greater aspirations. 

They have no information regarding the location of a Xhanatar base of operations. 

They can be convinced/talked into working with the PC's if they would so chose. Thus giving them some goons working for them. 

Information they do have access to:

* An individual who calls himself the Lord of Whips has been buying up a lot of slaves recently, his insignia is that of an H but that is all they know. 
They had some idea of getting into to the slave trade but has not yet been able to expand into it. 

* For undermountain they have 2 pieces of information. 
    1. During their excursions and visist to Undermountain they have noticed that some adventurers that has been down there for about 1-3 days have come back 
    acting a bit stiff or maybee awkward would be the more appropriate word for it. 

    2. They have managed to reach the second level of the dungeon complex and found some notes talking about researching some anti-mage weapon. 
    It should be able to nullify or remove mages ability to control the weave.


Should roll up and create a familiar for Stjärnsång and Hans.
I'm thinking thar Stjärnsång har kunnat spenderat max pengera och tid på att framana sin familiar

Hans är bland lower rangs för Economi, Mid för tid och Vortex.

In the town there are some criminals looking to get their hands on the fruits, they will setup an ambush for the PC's when they leave the dungeon. 

If they defeat the bandits and are a follower to a Religion that promotes such an act then they will either get a minor boon or honor reward. 
If they manage to rescue the travellers they will get additional honor reward and monetary reward. 

Afterwards they will be visited by the DROW looking for workers.

DROW sets up so that the party will be attacked during their travels to induce some level of trust, as they will share some of their healing potions, and help in combat. 
The reason she is on this quest is that she hopes that if she is able to release Lolth from her prison that she will be rewarded greatly and re-instationed. 

A long time ago shortly after Loths ascenion, as she began he rampage through the lands in preparations to attack the Feywild and exact her revenge. The Feyfolk in the form of the High elves, reached a suprisingly quick conclusion that something had to be done. And through a series of hardfought battles they were able to stop the assualt and push the drow back into the underdark and greatly injuring Loth by cuttin of her head. Her body now serves as little more than a power battery that acts as a Warlock Patron to her follower, but without the head Loth is effectivly neutralized unable to take any actions. 

Now as she raised them to be selfish assholes, many of the high ranking drows see little to no reason to put any real efforts to restore her greatness as they correctly assume that loth will once more take control over their society. 
But there are small factions that belive this current arrangement to be wrong and that Loth has to be restored. Most of the times these factions are found among the youths and if they are ever discovered they are severly punished if not killed. 

The Head of loth was effictly turned into a relic of its own and sealed in marble like stone. This statuet was then placed in a secure vault among the high elves for hundreds of years until the GROUP broke inn and stole whatever looked cool. 
The DROW belonged to one of the congregations beliving in Loths right to rule the drow and the world, disillusioned by the Drow Nobles that sit on their laurels not putting any real effort into restoring Loth. The group was however discovered and all but the DROW was killed it managing to flee to the surface. There it spent years tracking down any knowledge about the statuet and was able to come to the conclusion that it must be stored in one of the Treasure Hordes of the GROUP.
