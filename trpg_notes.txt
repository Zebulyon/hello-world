One-shot - Prision Break 

The PC's currently find themselves in the bottom floor of a prision, tomorrow the PC will be executed/sacrificed so that need to flee today. 
At the start of the Session, they will be asked what they have done to prepare the escape, each PC will be allowed to say what they have done to prepare. 

1. Prepared gears 
    * Made shivs
    * Potentially stolen weapons and hid them away for use
    * Might have some items hidden away in a stash that if they get to will grant them access to a variety of goddies 

2. Observered guard routines 
    * Will grant bonuses to stealth and bonus to knowledge checks 
    * Know where guards will be and when. 

3. Work on an escape route 
    * Maybe found some wall or floor tiles and worked them loose to gain shortcuts and the like 
    * Learnt the lay out allowing them to know good ways out 

4. Roused fellow inmates
    * Convince other inmates to aid them in their scheme would grant either heirling or distraction for the guards 


After deciding on what they want to have prepared a Roll will be asked for and the bonuses of their preperations will vary depending on results
and if it goes really badly might even introduce complixations. 

Potentially will have high leathality and if a PC dies they will simply be replaced by another inmate looking to flee up to certain point



I ran one a short while ago that went well (due to good dice rolling and some clever ideas)

Part one: Skill challenge to get the guards by the bars so they can be attacked. (Failure means retry later)

Part two: Combat with said guards (they should be very weak)

Part three: Skill challenge to sneak around and get some gear.(Failure means no gear)

Part four: Fighting the guards halfway out.

Part Five: Skill challenge to avoid group of guards coming in to investigate sound of fight. (Failure bing a fight)

Part six: skill challenge to get away form the possee that is pursuing them (Failure is another fight)

The party did well and got away with only three fights.

Just a quick update.

The PCs have finished making characters. All are level 4 and will start with no equipment, for the most part.

Male Human Thief. Street Urchin. Imprisoned for inciting a riot to depose the local iron-fisted tyrant.

Female Changeling Pyromancer Mage. Fluffed as a human with a knack for simple disguise spells. Imprisoned for impersonating the local iron-fisted tyrant during the riots. She managed to smuggle her implement in with her - a Hellfire Cinder Wand fluffed as a magic ring.

Male Longtooth Shifter Paladin. Worships the mysterious Death deity (similar in aspect to the Raven Queen, i.e. not evil). He is fluffed as a human with an anger management problem. Imprisoned for grotesque acts of random violence.

After looking over several sources, I've decided to base the layout of the prison mostly on Shroomy's suggestion of Blackmaw Prison from Dungeon 135. The layout is closest to what I had in mind, though I will be changing some of the details.

The lower level just empties into a waste pit, rather than a mine. This prison is much more bleak than the one envisioned in Blackmaw. The prisoners do not get to leave their cells to work; they are left to rot. Sometimes they don't get fed. There is no laundry facility or much of a kitchen.

The prison itself is a repurposed temple from an ancient culture similar to the mayans or aztecs, and as such the outer shape is very pyramid-like, with a long stair leading up to the top (where the outbuildings are), the centre has a hollow shaft where the elevator has been rigged up, though there is also a long, winding stair that goes around the outside of the (now square) shaft.

The cell blocks are similar to that in the module, but only has one row of cells on a given wall, and instead has the second row directly beneath the first. There are stairs at the end of each cell block to gain access. Each cell on the upper level has a grated hole in the floor where the waste from the cell passes through to a hole in the cieling of the cell below, and on through another grated hole in the floor of that cell. That is, assuming nobody is using the hole at the time.

The cell waste holes all exit out into the main waste shaft in the central chamber of the prison complex. The end of the lower cell block halls, where they are closest to the centre have a grated passage leading back into the main waste shaft.

The prison is filthy, humid, and hot at all times, as it is located in the steaming rainforest in a warm subtropical region of the world.

Escape is possible either by fighting through the guards to the surface (more straightforward, but tougher fights), or via the waste pit (disgusting, and more like an old-school dungeon crawl with Traps, Oozes, Undead, and Vermin).

Skill Challenge and a scuffle or two for the initial escape, then a choice and some more fighting and / or exploring.

This is really starting to come together. Thanks again for the help, fellows.

I ran my prison break last night.

The players were able to escape, and they took the way I thought was harder - they fought their way out through wave after wave of guards. They took on a level 7 encounter, even after the Pyromancer had already blown his daily during the initial escape. Nobody even dropped, though the Paladin came pretty close. He was handing out temporary hp like candy though, and his longtooth shifter regen was helping keep him up, as was resist all (wis mod) after spending a surge (from Virtuous Recovery).

The Thief was consistently doing 20-something damage per hit, which was nice; everyone commented on the Thief's damage output. Consistent, and high without being overpowered.

The Pyro-Mage was throwing some nice damage around as well with her cinder wand (she smuggled it in *somehow* ;) ), and got several critical hits in, typically 15-20 +1d8 +1d10, so that really helped as well.

The best part was that because they busted out that way, I still have an evening's worth of adventure for the next time we need to do a one-shot. I was actually hoping they would take the sewers, but I guess that will be for next time.

One more thing that I did was because everyone was without equipment, so as not to make them fall too far behind "expectations," I gave out two boons to each of them.

The Thief had Torog's Lament of the Shackled and Davros' Defensive Step, the Mage had her smuggled wand and also Primal Blessing of Fire, while the Paladin had two item-equivalent boons - one worked like a Cincture of the Dragon Spirit, and the other worked like a Belt of the Brawler.

Overall, we had a pretty good time. It was my first time DMing 4th edition (though I am a 20-year veteran GM with 2e, 3.x, Shadowrun, CoC, and Palladium) and I have to say that I thought it went pretty smoothly. Combat went decently quick, though that was probably at least partly due to only having 3 players, but we got through two at-level fights and one level +3 in the span of an evening, with roleplaying, a skill-challenge to break out, and collecting some spoils of victory.

My next actual campaign that I'll be starting in a few weeks will hopefully go as smoothly, though there will be twice the number of players. Thanks for reading, and comments (et cetera) are welcome.


I didn't, really. I picked things that I thought were fitting with the character's builds and theme so that it was "just part of them."

I ran the second session of this game last weekend. The players decided to finish exploring the temple after having released the prisoners.

They fell down a waste hole and into the sewage and offal. I hammed up the disgusting factor as much as I could.

They discovered an abandoned storage room where there were some barrels, two of which were still unspoiled (one was pickles, the other was some stout). They took their fill and for that I gave them all back a healing surge.

Moving along, they entered an area where the waste pit seemed to empty out into an older part of the temple, which turned out to be a catacomb from when the temple was still being built. Did I mention that it was a temple of the God of Death?

They got ambushed by an Otyugh and two Carrion Crawlers. Everyone got bloodied and the Thief dropped. He was rescued by the Paladin, however.

It was a short session, so that's as far as we got. They're about to do some poking around, I think, and discover an old reliquary with a powerful Mace for the Paladin waiting for them.

From time to time the PCs may find themselves incarcerated. There are plenty of reason why this might be the case, but I think it’s fair to say most PCs will try to escape if the alternative is life imprisonment or execution. How the PCs ended up in prison and what happens to them when they get out is entirely up to the DM. This skill challenge just focuses on scenarios the PCs may find themselves in while incarcerated. This can be run as one large skill challenge or a series of smaller ones.


Setup
The PCs are thrown in prison. They may be looking at hard labour, a life sentence or even execution. Unless they are content to die behind bars, escape is the only option. While imprisoned the PCs are given sub-standard rations and begin suffering form malnourishment and fatigue. If an escape plan is in the works, it should be attempted soon.

Why are the PCs in prison?
The PCs need information from a prisoner. The only way to meet with him face-to-face is to get thrown in prison along side of him. The PCs may pretend to be known criminals or may deliberately commit a crime in order to be thrown in prison.
The PCs have been framed for a crime they did not commit. The accusations are false, the evidence planted and the magistrate bribed. They have no chance of beating the rap honestly.
The PCs are guilty. Whether they knowing committed a criminal offensive (with good reason of course) or whether they unknowingly broke a law they were not aware of, they have ended up in prison.
Complexity
If this is run as one large skill challenge it should be a complexity 4 or 5. However, this might work better as a series of smaller complexity 1 skill challenges.

Primary Skills
Athletics, Acrobatics, Bluff, Endurance, Heal, History, Stealth, Streetwise, Thievery

Each skill can only be used to accomplish 1 success towards the overall skill challenge unless noted otherwise.
Skill checks denoted as assist do not count as a success or failure towards the overall skill challenge.
Other skills
Diplomacy, Insight, Perception

Acrobatics (hard DC)
Tumble gracefully from a balcony to gain access to a restricted area.

Athletics (moderate DC)

Diplomacy (moderate DC, assist)

Success: +2 to Streetwise or History.

Insight (moderate DC, assist)
Ferret out sympathetic guards and prisoners.

Success: +2 to Bluff check.

Intimidate (moderate DC)
Show strength in the face of a challenge to earn respect of fellow inmates.

Streetwise (easy DC)

Streetwise (medium DC)
Learn about the prison layout.

Streetwise (hard DC)

Thievery (hard DC)

Escaping Your Cell
Bluff (hard DC)

Endurance (hard DC)
Keep up your strength despite harsh conditions and poor food.

Insight (moderate DC, assist)

Success: +2 to Bluff check.

Perception (moderate DC, assist)
You act as the look out while attempting to escape from your cell.

Success: +2 to ally’s Stealth check.

Thievery (hard DC)
Pick the lock of the cell. The PC must have some kind of tools, even if improvised.

Escaping the Prison
Acrobatics (hard DC)
Tumble gracefully from a balcony to gain access to a restricted area.

Athletics (moderate DC)
Climb over a wall to gain access to a restricted area.

Athletics (hard DC)
Climb over the wall to escape the prison grounds.

History (moderate DC, maximum 2 successes)
Recall or learn something useful about the layout of the prison.

Perception (moderate DC, assist)
You act as the look out for anyone sneaking around the prison or climbing the wall.

Success: +2 to ally’s Stealth check.

Stealth (moderate DC)
Move about the prison without detection.

Stealth (hard DC)
Avoid detection in the yard.

Success
The PCs manage to break out of prison undetected. Which is not to say that they won’t be missed. They have a limited amount of time to put distance between themselves and the prison, but for now no one is looking for them.

Failure
The PCs are either caught before they escape the prison or manage to just make it out when they are detected. If they are caught before they escape then they will face severe punishment and most likely be moved to a more secure area (making future escape attempts more difficult). If they do manage to make it over the wall, they are spotted during the escape. Guards will be after them immediately. The chase is on.

The abomination uses stats similar to an Ooze. 
By that I mean that it has a lot of health, tought not all that much DR, like the normal Zombie. 
As well as if damaged enough by a cutting weapon it will start to split apart, each part being able to move by its self. 
It is capable to grab Number of PC's - 2 at the same time. And is able to bite multiple victims at once. 
Its bite is highly contaigouse with the zombie virus
Requiring victims do performs saves against the virus after each instance of an attack that draws blood. 
If it can successfully grab an victim and bite down. It will also be able to transfer rotgrubs into the victim. 

The area will also contain som wandering skeletons and the lonely zombie. 
As well as some crawling claws. 

The Hlevtagnis area, contains a total of 1d20+10 Grunts. The area also contains a number of different varieties of simple traps. 
Snare traps, simple spike traps, bear and fox traps, some odd more complicated arrow traps. 
The area overall contains a lot of scrap and rubble covering the floors. Mostly there to hide the traps. 
This area does not contain a lot of powerful items, instead this is were some slaves can be found on behalf of Hlevtagnis, some tortured adventures, random people from the streets. 
Some fenced and smuggled goods. Very small amounts of it is in actual cash and most of it will require access to a fencer to handle properly.

The goblins possess some items that they have found themselves as well as taken from other adventures. 

Cleric Scroll
Favors of the Protectors

LvL:            4
Range:          Touch
Components:     V, S
Duration:       Special, up to a maximum 24 h
Casting Time:   12 s
Area of Effect: 1 person or mammal
Saving Throw:   None

The favor of Tymora confers bonuses upon the recipient of +4 on the first saving throw 
made after the recipient is touched by the priest (even if the save occurs on the same round as the touch), 
+3 on the recipient's next saving throw, +2 on the one after that, then +1 on the following saving throw.

This spell can be added to the available spells of any cleric that is Good aligned


Mage scroll 
Whirling Blade

Lvl:            4
Range:          0
Components:     V, S
Duration:       10s / level
Casting Time:   2 s
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw:   None

This spell creates a shimmering, translucent silvery blade of force equal in dimensions and damage to a long sword. 
It orbits one of the caster's hands and strikes once per round as a magical weapon (+1 to ATK and DMG).

The blade is weightless, and passes through metallic things as though they did not exist, without affecting them.

Metal armor is discounted when determining armor class against blade attacks; i.e. targets receive dexterity 
and magical bonuses, but not metal shield and mail protection, creatures with naturally tough hides or natural 
armor plating have their usual armor classes!

A whirling blade also passes through the body of its caster without harm the caster is never imperilled by his own
weapon. The blade cannot break, but is destroyed instantly by contact with a Arcane Wall.

A whirling blade emits a continuous, high-pitched shrieking noise and vibrations of magical force that cannot be magically
silenced and therefore cannot be used with any measure of stealth. 
Note that the caster can hold or carry normal weapons and other inorganic objects in the hand wieleding the whirling blade 
without hampering its functioning, unless the carried objects are so large as to obstruct the caster's view of foes, or so 
heavy (10 pounds or more) as to hamper or significantly slow arm movement. 

This magical weapon exists for the duration given or until the caster concentrates on casting another spell, whereupon it vanishes. 
Wielding and actively using a weapon also disrupts the spell, canceling its effects prematurely.

Missjudged, the power of the Elfin mail, it is going to be an expensive endavour. 
As it is a chain mail, with only a -1 defense modifier. Making it just slightly worse 
than a +3 Leather armor. 

Priset är 5*En vanlig Chain mail = 1 000 SP = 100 GP 

It is not quite as expensive as one might think, the reason being that I would judge the problem
to be more of finding an elf capable of creating one, the processes is going to take 3 months to complete. 
Potentially it could be done sooner but at an increased prices. Take the amount of time reduction and multiply the price, 
to a minimum of 1 month. 

Ex. 3->1 month = 1/3 => 1000 * 3 = 3000 SP

Don and Hans are not real members of the Xhanatar Guild, they are simply somewhat low level thugs. 
Something which Don finds himself in but Hans has greater aspirations. 

They have no information regarding the location of a Xhanatar base of operations. 

They can be convinced/talked into working with the PC's if they would so chose. Thus giving them some goons working for them. 

Information they do have access to:

* An individual who calls himself the Lord of Whips has been buying up a lot of slaves recently, his insignia is that of an H but that is all they know. 
They had some idea of getting into to the slave trade but has not yet been able to expand into it. 

* For undermountain they have 2 pieces of information. 
    1. During their excursions and visist to Undermountain they have noticed that some adventurers that has been down there for about 1-3 days have come back 
    acting a bit stiff or maybee awkward would be the more appropriate word for it. 

    2. They have managed to reach the second level of the dungeon complex and found some notes talking about researching some anti-mage weapon. 
    It should be able to nullify or remove mages ability to control the weave.


Should roll up and create a familiar for Stjärnsång and Hans.
I'm thinking thar Stjärnsång har kunnat spenderat max pengera och tid på att framana sin familiar

Hans är bland lower rangs för Economi, Mid för tid och Vortex.

The Grand Treasure Hunt 

Setting 

It is 100 years ago that the greate war waged by Kalamar ended, The country after overextending in the war was begining to be pushed back, but on the verge of defeat the king spooken in legend appeared wielding the sword of kings. 
And through his heroics on the battlefield and insight in policitcal matters the war was able to end quite swiftly with Kalarmars border having been expanded quite greatly, swalowing Pekal amoung other countries. 

After this age of strife followed whilst tense an age of peace under the true kings reign. 
10 years after the war the Dwarfs that was enslaved by the Kalaramarian empire was released and laws was enacted that forbade discrimination against the other races on baseless grounds. 
The dwarfs was also given backs some of their old lands. 

But the choosen kings is approaching the end of his life, having already lived for an unatrual long time for a human being currently 138 years old, and concerns are beginning to grow that there will be a war of succession among his children for who will take over his rule. 

--

You however are adventures removed from the innerworkings of the royal court and all in all would likely stand to profit if a war of succession would erupt as that would mean that a lot more work would be availble. 
Your groups is one with experience having aided in the protection of merchants and villages from the horrors of goblinoids, bandits and wildlife. 

Tough your coffers are begining to wane, in the search of cheap living conditions and work you have moved yourself to be closer to the countries borders, specifically around the area of where some of the old dwarven cities were. 
On your journey to find a job, you came across the village of Greenest, a small village with around 50 pop, the only notisable thing of the village is that it houses the tower of a State sanctioned Wizard. 
The mayors daugther has fallen ill and so far they have found no cure, and being so far from a big city and they lack the funds and time to call for a high priest to come and save her. 

The village medicine womans belives the daughter to have less than a moons rotation left, and the mayor desprate for hope has asked you on a mission to go and investigate the validity of a rumor. 
Allegedly there is a village somewhat close by where there is a fruit able to cure any illness, he knows little else and would normally dismiss this is as whimsical hersay but there is little left for him to bet on. 

He has already spent most of what he has to cure her, but whatever left he can scrounge up without dooming the village he is willing to give you if you can get your hand on this fruit and return with it before his daugther dies. 
The resident Wizard also propmises that he will owe each of you a favor, a useufl thing to have. In the event you want to gain an inn to the collage in the Capital, identify some items, look through his spellbook, or custom order some scrolls and potions. 

Currently promised rewards - 45 sp per person i.e. a month stay at a private room at a regular inn, including cost for food and drink. 

Outside of the favor owed by the wizard, the party will be able to if they want to raise the payment, 
to aquire a scroll or a potion
or borrow a wagon and hierling that can drive it. 

The wagon and hierling will be included up front if there is a Priest belonging to a Lawful diety or NG diety in the party. 


It will take 
1 week by foot 
5 days by wagon 
4 days by horse 
Travel from Greenset to the Oakhurst

Meanwhile the small army of Twigblights will be bomb-rush the party.

    Not too much health as the people they represent are still alive but barely, they do however pose some good DR, slightly better than standard zombies. 
    They are able to wield weapons and cast spells as they are effectivly under a powerful charm spell.
    Hacking weapons will however be able to circumvent a lot of the DR, but kill the infected in the process.  
    Fire however is highly effective and more than half their HP is drained because of fire damage the infection will cease. 



The Druid.

Grieving the loss of his lover a Dryad. 
He found some humans, suffering symptoms of being poisoned. In his caring heart he reached out a helping hand and nurtured the individual back to health. 
At a later date the individuals returned saying that his assistance was needed. They said some nearby villagers had eaten something from the forest and turned sickly. And as such he set out to help them.

But it was all a ploy, he was lured into an ambush and nearly killed, but he was able to stave off his pursures. 
On top of that when he returned he saw how the clearing he called home had been ravaged, with his lover a dryad had been killed when the attackers had attempted to drain her of her sap. 
* The sap of a dryad posses anti-aging effects, not to the extent of a fountain of youth but it does slow down the aging of mortals.

??
In the Druids lair there is a hidden room. In there is a opening in the roof giving sunlight to a sapling, transplanted from the Dryad.
There also is his personal diary, telling his life story, but it also works as a tome providing bonus to aggriculture and botany. 
??

Afterwards they will be visited by the DROW looking for workers. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

During the night when most of the party has fallen asleep, a twig blight for each sleeping party member with creep up on the party looking to attack one of the sleeping PC's. 
The will try to reach the targets neck (a remnant of their vampire instincts), where upon they will strike looking to pierce it with their twig like appendages.

Any damage it deals leave some splinters in the targets wound. 
A (Average) First aid check is needed to remove it. 
A non crit-failed check deals the recipient 1 damage ignore DR as the splinter is removed forcefully
A crit-fail, causes some part of the splinter to remain in the wound and can lead to future complications. 


****
HP  : 4
DEF : +5
ATK : +3
DMG : 1d4+1 Piercing damage

DR  : (Look at Barksin)
- Weak to Hacking and Fire damage, to the point of instant death if damaged by such a source
- Small DR against Crushing 
- DR against Piercing 


Mosquito vision, able to find and discern heat sources, looking to find juicy blood bags. 

Skills 
Perception : 40
Sneaking 30 (+20 in natural terrian) 
Hiding whilst in hiding it is indistinguishable from a dead shrub. 


Intelligence is very low, acting mostly on instinct. 
But it instinct does tell it to look to attack sleeping foes, which i is able to determine from the heat and oxygen given of from its target. 
Otherwise it fights until death, it can be turned as if an undead Will factor 2.

If its corpse is investigated a check will reveal that in its head there is what looks like a fang like human tooth.

Magic Item 

The Dragon Egg 
A seemingly teardrop shaped saphire like jewel 

Any Lore checks leaves the investigator puzzled about its origins and purpose

But through experimentations one notices that it can absorb SP and when done so it will produce water. 

Small Cost will produce one pitchers worth of perferctly pure and clear drinking water. That seemingly begins to drip from the Jewel. 

After recieving a certain amount of SP a new ability will be unlocked 
The user can now shot out the water out to 20ft away but at the current moment is little more than a Squirt Gun.

After another threshold
The user can now fire out water to the level of a strong garden hose, not dangerous so far.

After another threshold
The user can now fire out compressed burst of water, dealing unarmed damage (d4-2)+(d4-2) + 2 up to a range of 20ft 

After another threshold
Damage increased to 2d4+2 


After another threshold
The water is now like a fire hose requireing the user to be able to withstand the pushback
It deals a good amount of damage at a range capable of chanign target to attack multiple enemies at a time. 


The Jewel is actually a dragon egg waiting to recieve enough SP before it is able to hatch, and will in turn empower it current holder to insentivce it continued useage.

The reason she is on this quest is that she hopes that if she is able to release Lolth from her prison that she will be rewarded greatly and re-instationed. 

A long time ago shortly after Loths ascenion, as she began he rampage through the lands in preparations to attack the Feywild and exact her revenge. The Feyfolk in the form of the High elves, reached a suprisingly quick conclusion that something had to be done. And through a series of hardfought battles they were able to stop the assualt and push the drow back into the underdark and greatly injuring Loth by cuttin of her head. Her body now serves as little more than a power battery that acts as a Warlock Patron to her follower, but without the head Loth is effectivly neutralized unable to take any actions. 

Now as she raised them to be selfish assholes, many of the high ranking drows see little to no reason to put any real efforts to restore her greatness as they correctly assume that loth will once more take control over their society. 
But there are small factions that belive this current arrangement to be wrong and that Loth has to be restored. Most of the times these factions are found among the youths and if they are ever discovered they are severly punished if not killed. 

The Head of loth was effictly turned into a relic of its own and sealed in marble like stone. This statuet was then placed in a secure vault among the high elves for hundreds of years until the GROUP broke inn and stole whatever looked cool. 
The DROW belonged to one of the congregations beliving in Loths right to rule the drow and the world, disillusioned by the Drow Nobles that sit on their laurels not putting any real effort into restoring Loth. The group was however discovered and all but the DROW was killed it managing to flee to the surface. There it spent years tracking down any knowledge about the statuet and was able to come to the conclusion that it must be stored in one of the Treasure Hordes of the GROUP.
