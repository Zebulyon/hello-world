So Formula for crafting something is as follwos:

Steve has an alchemy skill 33 [Average], knows the Recipe for Healing ointment and wants to make a does. 
Steve first procurs the necessary ingredient. Milk of the poppy, eggshells, and some lard. 

Then as Steve an Average level alchemist and is attempting to craft healing oitment, an item of the [Common] difficulty level. 
That means that the difficulty of the skill roll is modified by 0. 

But Steve knows the Recipe from having crafting it eariler in his carer.  Meaning it is an Base difficulty check of [Average], meaning an improvement of his skill roll by a factor of 40.

So Steve rolls his 1d100 and is looking to get a result equal to or less than 73 [33+40]

On a success he has made a dose of healing oitment.


Complete list of potion rarity class. Will be made available at a later date. 
All expected cost are not neccessarly set in stone. And for many of them it will create a batch of potions. 

When crafting potions a roll off the dice 001-005 indicates a critical success and will add something benefical. Be it more brew from the batch or an improved effect. 

When crafting potions in the event of failure. It means that the batch has gone to waste and either become inert or become dangerous to consume. 

When crafting potions a roll off the dice 095-100 indicates a critical failure, and will cause a cause problems. Potentially destroying the alchemical tools, starting a fire, or creating poison gas.  

Also when it comes to brews uncommon and above, remember that the Potion Mishaps Ability chart applies.

Making gunpowder in the Middle Ages? It wasn't a simple or quick process.

It seems that a passable form of gunpowder was made many centuries before it was used as a propellant. A poor man’s recipe of 100 parts of saltpeter to 24 parts of charcoal will work to make an incendiary. Sulfur was also needed to make propellants.

The main ingredient in gunpowder was saltpeter, a nitrate salt of potassium. Potassium nitrate, sulfur, and carbon react together to form nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases and potassium sulfide. The hot expanding gases, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, provide the propelling action.

Once acquired, the ingredients must be carefully and separately ground and later mixed in appropriate ratios. Ideally the recipe should include sulfur since sulfur is a stabilizing component and will greatly enhance the rapidity of reaction. However, the approximate common percentages by weight needed for a propellant are:

75% saltpeter
15% charcoal
12% sulfur
Carbon in the form of ground charcoal (preferably made from the wood of willow) gave the powder its black color, but well-ground charcoal from grapevine, hazel, elder, laurel, and pine cones (not resinous pine wood) have all been used.

Bulk quantities of sulfur (brimstone) could be imported from many places in the world blessed with volcanoes, or it could be extracted by evaporation and precipitation from the waters of sulfur springs. Italy and Sicily were common among these.

There were few places in the world, however, where saltpeter deposits could be mined directly. India was one of these — an almost inexhaustible supply of saltpeter found there. Also areas of the world like Chile where the droppings of seabirds or bats have accumulated are rich sources of niter. There were more advanced chemical schemes for producing artificial nitrate works, some of them required the laborious and time consuming extraction of nitrous salts from manure found on the earthen floors of stables, pigpens, cattle yards, and even from human excrement.
