So Formula for crafting something is as follwos:

Steve has an alchemy skill 33 [Average], knows the Recipe for Healing ointment and wants to make a does. 
Steve first procurs the necessary ingredient. Milk of the poppy, eggshells, and some lard. 

Then as Steve an Average level alchemist and is attempting to craft healing oitment, an item of the [Common] difficulty level. 
That means that the difficulty of the skill roll is modified by 0. 

But Steve knows the Recipe from having crafting it eariler in his carer.  Meaning it is an Base difficulty check of [Average], meaning an improvement of his skill roll by a factor of 40.

So Steve rolls his 1d100 and is looking to get a result equal to or less than 73 [33+40]

On a success he has made a dose of healing oitment.
