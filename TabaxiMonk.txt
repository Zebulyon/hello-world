Flash's Pirate Adventure 

There was also one time when I lacked the funds for traveling so I chose a random ship and
decided to become a stowaway.
To my amazement I learned it was a Pirate vessel, belonging to the Crimson Skull* pirate crew.

I was able to ingrate myself with the crew and captain, by aiding the crew in defeating some Giant Shark's
and personally saved the captain from the sharks jaws. 
Granted it was because he was currently holding some of my personal belongings, but who cares about the details.

The Crew Consisted of :

* The Captain 
- Alfred 'Rum Lover' Redcap
- Human 
- Enoy Wrestling. Made it a creed that disputes onboard should be settled by wrestling. 
- An Exotic Event t.642

* The Quarter master
- Elgin 'Two Toes' Stone
- Master Gunner

* The First Mate
- Lou-Lou Stubs

, the Captain (Alfred 'Rum Lover' Redcap) was not happy with me when they finally managed to
capture me, they took my stuff and prepared to make me walk the plank. That was one a
lesser swarm of GIANT Shark (CR 5 monster) attacked, one of them jumped the ship and
was able to knock Alfred and some crew down into the water. Seeing this and releasing that
Alfred had Velvet’s necklace with him when he fell in, caused me to dive down after. Would
likely have died as well if it wasn’t for the crew screaming that I should strike under its nose
just before the Jaw line to stun, and this combined with my THUNDER PAWS, allowed me
to reclaim my stuff, survive and rescue Alfred as well.
After that little endeavor, Alfred’s tune changed quite drastically and we were able to become
close friends. I journeyed with the Crimson skulls for about 1-2 years.
IT . . . WAS . . . LEGENDARY.
We fought sea-beasts, other pirate crews, and some navy people. During this time I was never
allowed to learn the location of their own treasure stash, but I did learn the location of the
Base of Operation for many of their rival Pirate Crew.
I then left the crew and continued on with my journeys , I carry a scarf of their jolly roger
around my neck, at most times
