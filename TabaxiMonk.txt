Flash's Pirate Adventure 

There was also one time when I lacked the funds for traveling so I chose a random ship and
decided to become a stowaway.
To my amazement I learned it was a Pirate vessel, belonging to the Crimson Skull* pirate crew.

I was able to ingrate myself with the crew and captain, by aiding the crew in defeating some Giant Shark's
and personally saved the captain from the sharks jaws. 
Granted it was because he was currently holding some of my personal belongings, but who cares about the details.
I served onboard for 4-5 years before I bagan to feel the desire to enter the next chapther of my long journey. 


During my time aboard, as I never gave the oath of joining the crew, I was never allowed to learn where the Crimson Skulls treasure hold is. 

I did however participate in a number of ship battles agains both rivals Pirate Crews and smaller Navy vessels. 
I fough against the pirate crews : The Black Vipers, The Weeping Skulls, Crimsion Tide, Ghastly Storm. 
The Crimsion Tide specifically seemed to have some personal rivalary with the Captain causes us to clash with them on a reguarlar basis and I even participated in an instance were we learned where their booty was hidden and raided it dry. 

Among the navy Corporal Jango was one we found ourselves in regualar conflict with, a Firbolg with mushrooms growing on his head. 
He is a cowardly little shit with a tendency to flee the scene whenever things began to go south, prefering to setup ambushes and traps. 

We braved the storm fighting for dear life against waves able to reach the crows nest. 
Had to flee from a dragon turtle really only managed to survive the encounter by leading it into a group of navy vessles which then caught its attention allowing us to book it away from there. 
We robbed some merchant vessels as well, a bit boring really they just kinda gave up when they saw our flag and imidietly surrenderd.

And fighting against some Sahuagins that dried to sink the ship during the night by drilling into the hull.  Forcing us to jump into the water to scare them off. 

I have since tehn been on my own journey for about 1-1.5 years now, going from port to port and trying to find a new exciting adventures.

, the Captain (Alfred 'Rum Lover' Redcap) was not happy with me when they finally managed to
capture me, they took my stuff and prepared to make me walk the plank. That was one a
lesser swarm of GIANT Shark (CR 5 monster) attacked, one of them jumped the ship and
was able to knock Alfred and some crew down into the water. Seeing this and releasing that
Alfred had Velvet’s necklace with him when he fell in, caused me to dive down after. Would
likely have died as well if it wasn’t for the crew screaming that I should strike under its nose
just before the Jaw line to stun, and this combined with my THUNDER PAWS, allowed me
to reclaim my stuff, survive and rescue Alfred as well.
After that little endeavor, Alfred’s tune changed quite drastically and we were able to become
close friends. I journeyed with the Crimson skulls for about 1-2 years.
IT . . . WAS . . . LEGENDARY.
We fought sea-beasts, other pirate crews, and some navy people. During this time I was never
allowed to learn the location of their own treasure stash, but I did learn the location of the
Base of Operation for many of their rival Pirate Crew.
I then left the crew and continued on with my journeys , I carry a scarf of their jolly roger
around my neck, at most times
